Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: for N < 1000 some teams are not placed in the dictionary (never won) thus the results are not complete

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: for N = 1000 as for langer N the list is stale enough but the computations longer
